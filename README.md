# simple-chatbot
This is a Python program to create a simple chatbot using OpenAI, LM Studio, or Together.ai.  It also creates a log of each conversation.  

Before getting started, run: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   
```
You also need to have an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com), or [Together AI key](https://together.ai), or have downloaded models with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) in order to use the programs.  After you get an API key, you will need to set it as an environmental variable.
